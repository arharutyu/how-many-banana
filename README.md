1. Measuring system: The program offers 2 conversion types. Metric (from metres to banana), or Imperial (from feet & inches to banana)
2. Item: The item used for converting

The program comes with a few pre programmed lengths of standard fruit/ items for your measuring pleasure. If you try to measure with an item that is not in the library, you will be prompted to add its' length, and the library will save these details for future conversion.

#### Quit
To exit the program enter ```\Q``` at the menu

#### Library 
Fruits and measurements in the standard library include:

| Item      | Measurement |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Banana      | 0.19       |
